# Disclaimer

The osu! staff tolerates running bots on your own osu! account, however you are not allowed to create a dedicated osu! account to your bot without acknowledging the staff. Any attempt to do so will be considered multi-accounting, which is against the osu! Terms of Use.
Normal accounts have undisclosed rate limits. Script-chan, by default, uses limits that are somewhat tested on user accounts but there's no guarantee provided. The test suite should always run fine though.
